A program that generates PacMen to bounce around your screen. An Exercise in Recursion and Asyn Functions utilizing HTML, CSS, and javascript. An Entirely too complicated little game.  

## How to Run

1. Download index.html, pacmen.js, and styles.css into a single file onto your machine.
2. Into that same file, download the images file. 
3. Drag and Drop index.html onto your browswer. 
4. It should load in the a white screen with two buttons.
5. One button will create pacmen, and the other will start the game.

## Future Updates
* Get the images to flip between open mouth and closed mouth while it moves
* Add a Mrs. PacMan variable
